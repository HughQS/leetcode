**[937. Reorder Data in Log Files](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-data-in-log-files/)**

You have an array of logs.  Each log is a space delimited string of words.

For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric identifier.  Then, either:

* Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
* Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.
We will call these two varieties of logs letter-logs and digit-logs.  It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.

Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.  The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties.  The digit-logs should be put in their original order.

Return the final order of the logs.

**Note:**

1. 0 <= logs.length <= 100
2. 3 <= logs[i].length <= 100
3. logs[i] is guaranteed to have an identifier, and a word after the identifier.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]
```

```java
class Solution {
    public String[] reorderLogFiles(String[] logs) {
        Arrays.sort(logs, (log1, log2)->{
            String[] log1a = log1.split(" ", 2);
            String[] log2a = log2.split(" ", 2);
            boolean isLetter1 = Character.isLetter(log1a[1].charAt(0));
            boolean isLetter2 = Character.isLetter(log2a[1].charAt(0));
            if(isLetter1 && isLetter2) {
                int cmp = log1a[1].compareTo(log2a[1]);
                if(cmp != 0)
                    return cmp;
                return log1a[0].compareTo(log2a[0]);
            }
            return !isLetter1 ? (!isLetter2 ? 0 : 1) : -1;
            
        });
        return logs;
    }
}
