**[922. Sort Array By Parity II](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-parity-ii/)**

Given an array A of non-negative integers, half of the integers in A are odd, and half of the integers are even.

Sort the array so that whenever A[i] is odd, i is odd; and whenever A[i] is even, i is even.

You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

**Note:**

1. 2 <= A.length <= 20000
2. A.length % 2 == 0
3. 0 <= A[i] <= 1000

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [4,2,5,7]
Output: [4,5,2,7]
Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] sortArrayByParityII(int[] A) {
        int[] res = new int[A.length];
        int j = 0, k = 1;
        for(int i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
            if(A[i] % 2 == 0) {
                res[j] = A[i];
                j += 2;
            } else {
                res[k] = A[i];
                k += 2;
            }                
        }
        return res;
    }
}
