**[1221. Split a String in Balanced Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-a-string-in-balanced-strings/)**

Balanced strings are those who have equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.

Given a balanced string s split it in the maximum amount of balanced strings.

Return the maximum amount of splitted balanced strings.


**Example 1:**


```
Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
Output: 4
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "RLLLLRRRLR"
Output: 3
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "LLLRRR", "LR", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
Output: 1
Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "RLRRRLLRLL"
Output: 2
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", since each substring contains an equal number of 'L' and 'R'
```

**Constraints:**

* 1 <= s.length <= 1000 <br/>
* s[i] = 'L' or 'R'

    public int balancedStringSplit(String s) {
        int res = 0, countL = 0, countR = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            switch(s.charAt(i)) {
                case 'L':
                    countL++;
                    break;
                case 'R':
                    countR++;
                    break;
            }
            if(countL == countR) {
                res++;
                countL = 0;
                countR = 0;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
