**[551. Student Attendance Record I](https://leetcode.com/problems/student-attendance-record-i/)**

You are given a string representing an attendance record for a student. The record only contains the following three characters:
1. **'A'** : Absent.
2. **'L'** : Late.
3. **'P'** : Present.
A student could be rewarded if his attendance record doesn't contain **more than one 'A'(absent)** or **more than two continuous 'L'**  (late).

You need to return whether the student could be rewarded according to his attendance record.

            }
            if(countA > 1 || countL >2)
                return false;
        }        
        return true;
