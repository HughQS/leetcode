**[686. Repeated String Match](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-string-match/)**

Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.

For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".

Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd").

**Note:**

The length of A and B will be between 1 and 10000.

```java
class Solution {
    public int repeatedStringMatch(String A, String B) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(A);
        int i = 1;
        for(; sb.length() < B.length(); i++) {
            sb.append(A);
        }
        if(sb.indexOf(B) >= 0)
            return i;
        if(sb.append(A).indexOf(B) >= 0)
            return i + 1;
        return -1;
    }
}
