**[461. Hamming Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/)**

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

**Note:**

0 ≤ x, y < 2<sup>31</sup>.


**Example 1:**
```
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

```java
class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int count = 0;
        int res = x ^ y;
        while(res != 0) {
            if((res & 1) == 1) {
                count++;                           
            }           
            res >>>= 1; 
        }            
        return count;
    }
}
