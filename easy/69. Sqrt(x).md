**69. Sqrt(x)**

Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.


**Example 1:**
```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {   
        if(x==0 || x==1)
           return x;
        int left =1 , right = x, mid = 0, ans = 0;
        while(left<=right)
        {
            mid = (left + right)/2;
            if(mid == x / mid) return mid;
            if(mid < x / mid) {left = mid + 1; ans=mid;}
            else right = mid-1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
