**[543. Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)**

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the **longest** path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

**Example :**

Given a binary tree

```
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5   
```

Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

**Note:**

The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

        return res - 1;                
    }
    
    private int depth(TreeNode node) {
        if(node == null)
            return 0;
        int left = depth(node.left);
        int right = depth(node.right);
        res = Math.max(res, left + right + 1);
        return Math.max(left, right) + 1;
    }
}
