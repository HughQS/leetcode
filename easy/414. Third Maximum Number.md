**[414. Third Maximum Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/third-maximum-number/)**

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the **third** maximum number in this array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity must be in O(n).


**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3, 2, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: The third maximum is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1, 2]

Output: 2

Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
```

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2, 2, 3, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.
Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int thirdMax(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0, max = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        for(int i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
           if(max > nums[i]) {
               max = nums[i];
               count++;
           }
            if(count == 3)
                return max;
        }
        return nums[nums.length - 1];
    }
}
