**136. Single Number**

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

**Note::**
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int bitSum = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            bitSum ^= nums[i]; 
        }
        return bitSum;
    }
}
```
