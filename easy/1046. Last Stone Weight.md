**[1046. Last Stone Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight/)**

We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose the two **heaviest** rocks and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:

* If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
* If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)

**Note:**

1. 1 <= stones.length <= 30
2. 1 <= stones[i] <= 1000

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of last stone.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int lastStoneWeight(int[] stones) {        
        if(stones.length == 1)
            return stones[0];
        int num = stones.length;
        int fmax = num - 1;
        int smax = num - 2;
        Arrays.sort(stones);
        while(num > 1) {
            if(stones[fmax] == stones[smax]) {
                stones[smax] = 0;
                stones[fmax] = 0;
                num -= 2;
            } else {
                stones[fmax] = stones[fmax] - stones[smax];
                stones[smax] = 0;
                num -= 1;
            }
            Arrays.sort(stones);
        }
        return stones[fmax];
    }
