    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        int[] count = new int[26];        
        char[] sc = s.toCharArray();
        char[] tc = t.toCharArray();
        for(int i = 0; i < sc.length; i++) {
            count[sc[i] - 'a']++;
        }
        for(int i = 0; i < tc.length; i++) {
            if(count[tc[i] - 'a'] == 0) {
                return tc[i];
            }
            else
                count[tc[i] - 'a']--;
        }
        return tc[tc.length - 1];
    }
