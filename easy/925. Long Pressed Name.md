**[925. Long Pressed Name](https://leetcode.com/problems/long-pressed-name/)**

Your friend is typing his name into a keyboard.  Sometimes, when typing a character c, the key might get long pressed, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

You examine the typed characters of the keyboard.  Return True if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

**Note:**

1. name.length <= 1000
2. typed.length <= 1000
3. The characters of name and typed are lowercase letters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
Output: true
Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"
Output: false
Explanation: 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it wasn't in the typed output.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: name = "leelee", typed = "lleeelee"
Output: true
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: name = "laiden", typed = "laiden"
Output: true
Explanation: It's not necessary to long press any character.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isLongPressedName(String name, String typed) {
        char[] nc = name.toCharArray();
        char[] tc = typed.toCharArray();
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int countn = 0;
        int countt = 0;
        if(tc[0] != nc[0])
            return false;
        while(i < nc.length && j < tc.length) {
            countn = 1;
            countt = 1;
            i++;
            j++;
            while(i < nc.length && nc[i] == nc[i - 1]) {
                i++;
                countn++;
            }
            while(j < tc.length && tc[j] == tc[j - 1]) {
                j++;
                countt++;
            }
            if(countt < countn || (i < nc.length && j < tc.length && nc[i] != tc[j]))
                return false;            
            
        }
        if(!(i  == nc.length && j == tc.length))
            return false;
        return true;
    }
