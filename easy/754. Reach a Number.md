**[754. Reach a Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/reach-a-number/)**

You are standing at position 0 on an infinite number line. There is a goal at position target.

On each move, you can either go left or right. During the n-th move (starting from 1), you take n steps.

Return the minimum number of steps required to reach the destination.


**Note:**

* target will be a non-zero integer in the range [-10^9, 10^9].

**Example 1:**

```
Input: target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
On the first move we step from 0 to 1.
On the second step we step from 1 to 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: target = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
On the first move we step from 0 to 1.
On the second move we step  from 1 to -1.
On the third move we step from -1 to 2.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int reachNumber(int target) {
        int newTarget = Math.abs(target);
        int step = 0, sum = 0;        
        while (sum < newTarget || (sum - newTarget) % 2 == 1) {
            sum += step;
            step++;
        }
        return step - 1;
    }
}
