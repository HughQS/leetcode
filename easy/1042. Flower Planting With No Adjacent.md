**[1042. Flower Planting With No Adjacent](https://leetcode.com/problems/flower-planting-with-no-adjacent/)**

You have N gardens, labelled 1 to N.  In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.

paths[i] = [x, y] describes the existence of a bidirectional path from garden x to garden y.

Also, there is no garden that has more than 3 paths coming into or leaving it.

Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.

Return any **such** a choice as an array answer, where answer[i] is the type of flower planted in the (i+1)-th garden.  The flower types are denoted 1, 2, 3, or 4.  It is guaranteed an answer exists.

**Note:**

1. 1 <= N <= 10000
2. 0 <= paths.size <= 20000
3. No garden has 4 or more paths coming into or leaving it.
4. It is guaranteed an answer exists.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: N = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: N = 4, paths = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: [1,2,1,2]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: N = 4, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] gardenNoAdj(int N, int[][] paths) {
        int[] res = new int[N];
        Arrays.fill(res, 1);
        boolean stop = true;
        do {
            stop = true;
            for(int[] edge : paths) {
                int min = Math.min(edge[0], edge[1]) - 1;
                int max = Math.max(edge[0], edge[1]) - 1;
                if(res[min] == res[max]) {
                    stop = false;
                    res[max] = (res[max] == 4) ? 1 : res[max] + 1;
                }
            } 
        } while(!stop);
        return res;
    }
