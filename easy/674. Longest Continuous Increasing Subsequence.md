**[674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/)**

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence (subarray).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. 
```

**Note:**Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findLengthOfLCIS(int[] nums) {
        int start = 0, maxLength = 0;
        if(nums.length <= 1)
            return nums.length;
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if(nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]) {
                int length = i - start;
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, length);
                start = i;
            }
        }
        return Math.max(maxLength, nums.length - start);
    }
}
