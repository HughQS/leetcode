**[771. Jewels and Stones](https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/)**

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".


**Note:**

* S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
* The characters in J are distinct.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        char[] jc = J.toCharArray();
        char[] sc = S.toCharArray();
        int res = 0;
        for(char c : jc)
            set.add(c);
        for(char c : sc) {
            if(set.contains(c))
                res++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
