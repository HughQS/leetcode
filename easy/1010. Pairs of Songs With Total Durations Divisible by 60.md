**1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60**

In a list of songs, the i-th song has a duration of time[i] seconds. 

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60.  Formally, we want the number of indices i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [30,20,150,100,40]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [60,60,60]
Output: 3
Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.
```

**Note:**
```
1 <= time.length <= 60000
1 <= time[i] <= 500
```

**Solution:**
```java
class Solution {
    public int numPairsDivisibleBy60(int[] time) {
        int count = 0;
        if(time.length < 2)
            return 0;
        Map<Integer,Integer> m = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < time.length; i++)
        {
            int val = time[i] % 60;
            if(m.containsKey(60 - val))
                count = count + m.get(60 - val);
            if(!m.containsKey(val))
                m.put(val,1);
            else 
                m.put(val,m.get(val) + 1); 
        }
        if(m.containsKey(0))
        {
            int val = m.get(0);
            return count + (val - 1) * val / 2;
        }
        return count;
        
    }
}
```
