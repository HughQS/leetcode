**[812. Largest Triangle Area](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-triangle-area/)**

You have a list of points in the plane. Return the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any 3 of the points.

**Note:**

* 3 <= points.length <= 50.
* No points will be duplicated.
*  -50 <= points[i][j] <= 50.
* Answers within 10^-6 of the true value will be accepted as correct.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The five points are show in the figure below. The red triangle is the largest.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public double largestTriangleArea(int[][] points) {
        int N = points.length;
        double ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
            for (int j = i+1; j < N; ++j)
                for (int k = j+1; k < N; ++k)
                    ans = Math.max(ans, area(points[i], points[j], points[k]));
        return ans;
    }

    public double area(int[] A, int[] B, int[] C) {
        return 0.5 * Math.abs(A[0]*B[1] + B[0]*C[1] + C[0]*A[1]
                             -A[1]*B[0] - B[1]*C[0] - C[1]*A[0]);
    }
}
