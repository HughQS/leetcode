**[1339. Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-splitted-binary-tree/)**

Given a binary tree root. Split the binary tree into two subtrees by removing 1 edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees are maximized.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

**Example 1：**

![](./png/1339_sample_1_1699.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 110
Explanation: Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 11 and 10. Their product is 110 (11*10)

```

**Example 2：**

![](./png/1339_sample_2_1699.png)

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,null,null,5,6]
Output: 90
Explanation:  Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 15 and 6.Their product is 90 (15*6)

```

**Example 3：**


```
Input: root = [2,3,9,10,7,8,6,5,4,11,1]
Output: 1025

```

**Example 4：**

```
Input: root = [1,1]
Output: 1

```

        long result = sum(node.left, total) + sum(node.right, total) + node.val;
        res = Math.max(res, (total - result) * result);
        return result;
