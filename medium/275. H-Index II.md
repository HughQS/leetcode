**[275. H-Index II](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index-ii/)**

Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each."

**Example 1：**

```
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

```

**Note:**

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

**Follow up:**

* This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
* Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?

```java
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        if(citations == null || citations.length == 0)
            return 0;
        int N = citations.length;
        if(citations[0] >= N)
            return N;
        for(int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
            int h = N - i;
            if(citations[i] >= h && citations[i - 1] <= h ){                
                return h;
            } 
        }
        return 0; 
    }
}
