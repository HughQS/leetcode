**[260. Single Number III](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/)**

Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

**Example 1ï¼š**

```
Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]

```

**Note:**

1. The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
2. Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

**Solution:**

Runtime: 3 ms<br/>
Memory Usage: 42.5 MB

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();        
        for(int n : nums) {
            if(set.contains(n))
                set.remove(n);
            else
                set.add(n);
        }
        int[] res= new int[2];
        int i = 0;
        for(Integer n : set) {
            res[i++] = n;            
        }
        return res;
    }
}

```
