**[1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-node-and-ancestor/)**

Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value V for which there exists different nodes A and B where V = |A.val - B.val| and A is an ancestor of B.

(A node A is an ancestor of B if either: any child of A is equal to B, or any child of A is an ancestor of B.)

```
Input: [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
|8 - 3| = 5
|3 - 7| = 4
|8 - 1| = 7
|10 - 13| = 3
Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.

```

**Note:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is between 2 and 5000.
* Each node will have value between 0 and 100000.

    public int maxAncestorDiff(TreeNode root) {        
        dfs(root, root.val, root.val);
        return res;
    }
    public void dfs(TreeNode node, int min, int max) {
        if(node == null)
            return;
        res = Math.max(res, Math.max(node.val - min, max - node.val));
        if(node.val < min)
            min = node.val;
        if(node.val > max)
            max = node.val;
        dfs(node.left, min, max);
        dfs(node.right, min, max);        
    }
}
