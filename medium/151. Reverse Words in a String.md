**[151. Reverse Words in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/)**

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

**Note:**

* A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
* Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
* You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string. 


**Example 1：**

```
Input: "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"

```

**Example 2：**

```
Input: "  hello world!  "
Output: "world! hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

```

**Example 3：**

```
Input: "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

```

**Solution:**

使用空格正则来将字符串分为字符串数组，再使用StringBuilder。

Runtime: 5 ms<br/>
Memory Usage: 41.4 MB

```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] arr = s.trim().split("\\s+");
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for(int i = arr.length - 1; i > 0;  i--) {            
            sb.append(arr[i] + " ");
        }
        sb.append(arr[0]);
        return sb.toString();
    }
}

```
