**[11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)**

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note:** You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int max = 0, left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
        while( left < right) {
            max = Math.max(max, (right - left) * Math.min(height[left], height[right]));
            if(height[left] < height[right])
                left++;
            else
                right--;
        }
        return max;
    }
}
