**[207. Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)**

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

**Example 1：**

```
Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

```

**Example 2：**

```
Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

```

**Note:**

1. The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
2. You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        ArrayList[] edge = new ArrayList[numCourses]; // 边
        int[] inDegree = new int[numCourses]; //顶点入度
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i) {
            edge[i] = new ArrayList<>();;
        }
        for (int[] p : prerequisites) {
            edge[p[1]].add(p[0]); //边
            ++inDegree[p[0]];   //顶点入度
        }
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i) {
            if (inDegree[i] == 0) q.offer(i);
        }
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int pre = q.poll();
            for (Integer post : (ArrayList<Integer>) edge[pre]) {  
                --inDegree[post];
                if (inDegree[post] == 0) q.offer(post);
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i) {
            if (inDegree[i] != 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
