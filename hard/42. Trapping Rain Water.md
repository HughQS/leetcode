**[42. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)**

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Thanks Marcos for contributing this image!

Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6

**Solution:**

There are two pointer: the left pointer and the right pointer. The left pointer travels the array along with the left direction and get the maxL value. Similarly,the right pointer travels the array along with the right direction. When the value of array height[left] is less than height[right],we calculates the water of the left side. Otherwise,we calculates the water of the right side.

```java
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        if(height == null || height.length == 0)
    		return 0;
    	int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
    	int maxL = 0, maxR = 0, res = 0;
    	while(left < right) {
    		if(height[left] < height[right]) {
    			maxL = Math.max(maxL, height[left]);
    			res += (maxL - height[left]);
    			left++;
    		} else {
    			maxR = Math.max(maxR, height[right]);
    			res += (maxR - height[right]);
    			right--;
    		}
    	}
        return res;
    }
}
